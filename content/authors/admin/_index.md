Hi! I am a Data Scientist at the [CUNY Institute for State and Local Governance](https://islg.cuny.edu/) supporting work on the [Safety and Justice Challenge](https://www.safetyandjusticechallenge.org/) and the NYPD Reform initiative. I was a [Bright Line Watch](http://brightlinewatch.org/) Fellow and Research Associate at Dartmouth College in the Department of Quantitative Social Science. I graduated with a Master's degree in Political Science from McGill University in Montr√©al, Canada, where I was a member of the [Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca/). I like wrestling with social science questions using a combination of experimental and quasi-experimental techniques.
