Hello! I am a graduate student at McGill University in the Department of Political Science, and a member of the [Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca/). I am broadly interested in applying experimental design principles and statistical techniques to make causal inferences in the social sciences. I study comparative voting behaviour and electoral institutions.
