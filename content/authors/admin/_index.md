Hi! I am the current [Bright Line Watch](http://brightlinewatch.org/) Fellow and Research Associate at Dartmouth College in the Department of Quantitative Social Science. I graduated with a Master's degree in Political Science from McGill University in Montr√©al, Canada, where I was a member of the [Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca/). I am broadly interested in applying experimental design principles and statistical techniques to make causal inferences in the social sciences. I study comparative voting behaviour and electoral institutions.
