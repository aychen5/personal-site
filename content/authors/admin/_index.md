Hi! I am a social data scientist/computational social scientist/quantitative researcher. For the past few years, I've been supporting public safety analytics at the CUNY Institute for State and Local Governance by building data pipelines and applying statistical/ML models to understand policing. Previously, I had a stint in academia and spent a lot of time thinking about how people consume and interact with information online.

I'm currently looking for opportunities to make an impact in climate tech and ways to engage in environmental/sustainability efforts at any level. 

Outside of work, you'll almost certainly find me on a tennis court, with my nose in a good book, or oil painting!
