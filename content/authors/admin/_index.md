Hi! I am the current [Bright Line Watch](http://brightlinewatch.org/) Fellow and Research Associate at Dartmouth College in the Department of Quantitative Social Science. I graduated with a Master's degree in Political Science from McGill University in Montr√©al, Canada, where I was a member of the [Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca/). I like grappling with social science questions by using experimental and quasi-experimental strategies to make causal inferences and often find the assumptions underlying causal interpretations equally as interesting. Recently, I have been thinking about the spread of misinformation online and content moderation.
