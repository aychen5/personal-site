Hi! I am a social data scientist | computational social scientist | quantitative researcher. I spent the past few years supporting public safety research for local government by designing studies and making sense of data using statistical/ML models. 

I'm currently exploring opportunities to make an impact in climate tech and ways to engage in environmental/sustainability efforts at any level.

Outside of work, you will almost certainly find me on a tennis court, with my nose in a good book, or painting and crafting!
